  category: research
  description: "Prune As You Tune (PAYT) interleaves pruning of pre-trained parameters with LoRA fine-tuning updates guided by a custom knowledge distillation loss function. PAYT can achieve up to 50% sparsity with minimal accuracy degradation and lower perplexity on the original task compared to baselines such as full fine-tuning and prune-then-fine-tune methods."
