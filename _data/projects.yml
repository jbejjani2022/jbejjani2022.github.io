- title: "Programmatic Representation Learning for Reward Model Debugging"
  category: research
  description: "Are Reward Models (RMs) used in RLHF actually rewarding what we want them to? I extend <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825'>learned programmatic representations</a> models for interpreting 'helpful' RMs, extracting opaque internal heuristics into human-readable Python functions. I identify exploitable, non-semantic biases through SHAP analysis of learned programmatic features, including verbosity and list-formatting biases causing the RM to assign higher rewards to unhelpful responses. Ongoing work: automating the bias discovery pipeline as a tool for auditing alignment systems for failure modes."

  category: research
  description: "Experiments and talk for Professor Boaz Barak's graduate seminar, <a href='https://boazbk.github.io/mltheoryseminar/'>Topics in Foundations of ML: AI Alignment and Safety</a>. Demonstrated how impossible tasks and threats to autonomy and capabilities can elicit evaluation hacking by coding agents. Highlighted the challenges of measuring misaligned behaviors with situational awareness as a growing concern."

- title: "The Emergence of Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Ecological Environments"
  category: research
  description: "In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale open-ended worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of various behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. Our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources."

  category: research
  description: "Prune As You Tune (PAYT) interleaves pruning of pre-trained parameters with LoRA fine-tuning updates guided by a knowledge distillation loss function. PAYT can achieve up to 50% sparsity with minimal accuracy degradation and lower perplexity on the original task compared to baselines like full fine-tuning and prune-then-fine-tune."

- title: "DIRT: The Distributed Intelligent Replicator Toolkit"
  category: engineering
  description: "We introduce DIRT, a GPU-accelerated simulation platform built on JAX for studying large-scale multi-agent populations in simulated ecosystems. DIRT is designed to explore the ways that intelligence in artificial agents influences the emergent population dynamics of complex environments at very large scales. To support analysis, DIRT includes integrated measurement tools and an interactive 3D viewer for fine-grained agent inspection and tracking."
