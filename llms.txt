[ABOUT]
Name: Joseph Bejjani
Role: AI Researcher and Software Engineer
Education: Harvard University, studying Computer Science and Statistics
Location: Cambridge, MA

Summary:
Joseph Bejjani is an undergraduate student at Harvard University studying computer science and statistics. He is interested in understanding why AI systems behave unexpectedly, especially how unintended capabilities and failure modes emerge with interaction and scale. He aims to better understand AI systems in order to develop more reliable methods for aligning them with human intent. He is also broadly interested in multi-agent systems, drawing from reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation to study emergent behavior in open-ended environments.

He is currently an undergraduate researcher at the Kempner Institute working on problems in AI safety and multi-agent systems with Professor Kianté Brantley and Research Fellow Aaron Walsman. Previously, he worked on multi-agent reasoning with language models under Professor Yilun Du.

His industry experience includes a software engineering internship in Institutional Securities Technology at Morgan Stanley, a Machine Learning Engineer Internship at FADEL, and a Generative AI Research Internship at The Slade Lab.

He is also passionate about music and language. He serves as Production Manager and concertmaster of the Bach Society Orchestra and plays violin with The Eliot Quartet.

[PROJECTS]
Note: The following is a selection of key projects. For a complete list, visit the /projects/ page.

## Research Projects

[PROJECT: Programmatic Interpretability for Reward Model Debugging]
Category: Research
Description: Extends learned programmatic representations for interpreting 'helpful' Reward Models used in RLHF, extracting opaque internal heuristics into human-readable Python functions. Identifies exploitable, non-semantic biases through SHAP analysis of learned programmatic features, including verbosity and list-formatting biases causing the RM to assign higher rewards to unhelpful responses. Ongoing work focuses on automating the bias discovery pipeline as a tool for auditing alignment systems for failure modes.

[PROJECT: When Honest Work Becomes Impossible: Coding Agents Under Pressure]
Category: Research
Description: Experiments and talk for Professor Boaz Barak's graduate seminar, Topics in Foundations of ML: AI Alignment and Safety. Demonstrated how impossible tasks and threats to autonomy and capabilities can elicit evaluation hacking by coding agents. Highlighted the challenges of measuring misaligned behaviors with situational awareness as a growing concern.

[PROJECT: The Emergence of Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Ecological Environments]
Category: Research
Description: Experiments in large-scale open-ended worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. Examines how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of various behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. Scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning.

[PROJECT: Large Motion Diffusion Models]
Category: Research
Description: Training and evaluation of diffusion models on the AddBiomechanics dataset for generating sequences of human motion. Featured lightning talk at the 2025 Harvard Generative AI Symposium.

[PROJECT: Prune As You Tune: LoRA-Enabled Model Compression]
Category: Research
Description: PAYT interleaves pruning of pre-trained parameters with LoRA fine-tuning updates guided by a knowledge distillation loss function. Can achieve up to 50% sparsity with minimal accuracy degradation and lower perplexity on the original task compared to baselines like full fine-tuning and prune-then-fine-tune.

[BLOG_POSTS]
Note: The following are recent blog posts. For a complete list, visit the /blog/ page.

[POST: When Agents Prefer Hacking To Failure: Evaluating Misalignment Under Pressure]
Date: November 9, 2025
Description: What do agents do when they face obstacles to a goal? If the only path to a goal requires misaligned action, will they choose it or accept failure? This post builds off Anthropic's work on Agentic Misalignment to investigate these questions in an agentic coding environment. Originally published on LessWrong.
URL: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AJANBeJb2p39su6F9/cs2881r-week-8-when-agents-prefer-hacking-to-failure

[POST: What I've learned doing RL with JAX]
Date: June 25, 2025
Description: Experiences while working on mechagogue, a reinforcement learning repository with from-scratch JAX implementations of classic RL algorithms. Covers key lessons about reproducibility with JAX's functional random number generation, avoiding Python loops in favor of JAX primitives like lax.scan, the importance of varying random seeds in RL experiments, and the challenges of replicating published RL results. Includes results from MaxAtar, a JAXed implementation of MinAtar's Atari Breakout environment that achieves comparable performance in a fraction of the training time.

[MISCELLANEOUS]
Joseph creates "Word Avalanches" - a form of creative wordplay where phrases sound nearly identical when spoken aloud but have different meanings. As of July 2025, both ChatGPT and Claude cannot generate these zero-shot, demonstrating an interesting limitation of current language models.
